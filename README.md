# students-performance-
our data is about students performance in many exams and compare between the scores of the students who take preparation course and who didn't take the course
# I asked the next questions that its answer in the data 
1-Are the scores of different subjects related ? Is a bad score in Math usually means the student's mars in reading and writing are bad?
Ans: As we could see , reading and writing scores are highly correlated so bad score of writing may indicate bad score in reading. Although math isn't that highly correlated with others so it may differ for math scores a little
2-How effective is the test preparation course?
Ans: It’s very effective because the students who took the course got higher test scores on all the tests unlike to those who didn’t took the course
3- Is parental education level an effective factor in students scores ?
Ans: Actually it didn't show much effect as others factors. we could see the distributions of students scores for different parental educational levels didn't differ significally
4-What factors mostly affected the scores?
Ans: The highest factor that contribute to test outcomes is the test preparation course and followed by the lunch and lastly is the gender, though race/ethnicity has quite influence on the test scores, its very little.
5-What would be the best way to improve student scores on each test?
Ans: As gender and race can't be changed, we may work on other factors we can control like lunch and preparation course
